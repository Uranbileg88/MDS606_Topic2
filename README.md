# Overview of the project

This is the research project journal of Group 2 for SPI MDS606 Data Science Research and Ethics.

Research topic:
Impact of AI on Cybersecurity: Investigate how Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are used to enhance cybersecurity measures, detect threats, and mitigate cyber attacks.

## Project Description

Research Question:

1. How can machine learning algorithms be leveraged to develop an effective threat detection system that enhances cybersecurity by identifying and mitigating potential cyber threats in real-time?

Hypothesis: 

1. Machine learning algorithms, when properly trained and integrated into cybersecurity systems, can significantly enhance the effectiveness of real-time threat detection by improving accuracy, reducing false positives, and enabling faster identification and mitigation of potential cyber threats.

2. The integration of AI in cybersecurity systems leads to a measurable reduction in false positive alerts compared to traditional security methods.
