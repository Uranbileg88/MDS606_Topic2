# Overview of the project

This is the research project journal of Group 2 for SPI MDS606 Data Science Research and Ethics.

### Research topic:
Impact of AI on Cybersecurity: Investigate how Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are used to enhance cybersecurity measures, detect threats, and mitigate cyber attacks.

## Project Description

### Research Question:
How can machine learning algorithms be leveraged to develop an effective threat detection system that enhances cybersecurity in real-time?

### Hypothesis: 
Machine learning algorithms, when properly trained and integrated into cybersecurity systems, can significantly enhance the effectiveness of real-time threat detection.

### Research Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and evaluate a machine learning-based threat detection system for enhancing real-time cybersecurity by accurately identifying and assessing potential threats in real time. In this project, we will investigate the integration of machine learning algorithms into cybersecurity systems, optimize model training for improved detection accuracy, and assess the effectiveness of the system in detecting and responding to dynamic cyber threats. Moreover, the research will establish the best practices for deploying machine learning in cybersecurity in a manner that meets critical data protection requirements while also aligning with industry standards.
