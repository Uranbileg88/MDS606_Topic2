1.	Research Topic: Impact of AI on Cybersecurity: Investigate how Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning are used to enhance cybersecurity measures, detect threats, and mitigate cyber-attacks.

Cybersecurity has become a critical concern in today's increasingly digital world, as the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks continue to rise. The need for real-time, adaptive security systems capable of detecting and responding to evolving threats is more urgent than ever. Traditional methods, such as signature-based detection, often struggle to identify novel or complex attacks, creating a significant gap in defense mechanisms. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can play a transformative role.

The integration of AI and ML into cybersecurity represents a promising frontier, offering the potential to not only detect known threats but also anticipate and identify previously unseen risks. By analyzing large volumes of data in real-time, AI and ML can uncover subtle patterns and anomalies that may indicate a breach or cyberattack, often before any significant damage occurs. This research interests me because it explores how these cutting-edge technologies can enhance real-time threat detection, making security systems more adaptive, efficient, and capable of defending against a dynamic and ever-changing threat landscape.

Through this study, the goal is to contribute to the development of more resilient cybersecurity systems that leverage AI and ML to provide proactive, continuous protection against the growing and increasingly complex array of cyber threats. This area of research is not only timely but also essential for safeguarding sensitive data, maintaining privacy, and ensuring the security of digital infrastructure.

2.	Research Question:
   
How can machine learning algorithms be leveraged to develop an effective threat detection system that enhances cybersecurity in real-time?

3.	Hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: 

Machine learning-based threat detection systems will demonstrate higher accuracy in identifying real-time cyber threats compared to traditional signature-based detection methods.
This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the performance of a machine learning-based system with traditional cybersecurity methods in terms of detection accuracy, false positive rates, and false negative rates in real-time environments.

Hypothesis 2: 

The integration of machine learning algorithms into cybersecurity systems will improve the responsiveness of threat detection, reducing the time taken to identify and respond to emerging threats.
This can be tested by measuring the time between threat detection and response for machine learning-based systems versus traditional systems, analyzing how quickly machine learning models can adapt to new attack patterns.

Hypothesis 3: 

Continuous training of machine learning models with new data and evolving threat patterns will enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of cybersecurity systems in detecting novel or sophisticated cyber threats over time.
This hypothesis can be tested using statistical tests to analyze if the ongoing training model performs better than the baseline in terms of detection, adaptability, and response time.

Sources of Data
For this research on machine learning-based threat detection in cybersecurity, several sources of data will be used to train, test, and evaluate the proposed models. These data sources will include publicly available datasets and proprietary data (Potential Collaboration).

1. Downloading from Public Repositories:

Kaggle and UCI: Download publicly available datasets from platforms like Kaggle and UCI, which offer both labeled and unlabeled data suitable for machine learning tasks in cybersecurity.

Method: 

Register on the platform, download relevant datasets, and preprocess them for model training and evaluation.

2. Collaborating with Cybersecurity Companies:

Data Sharing Agreements:

Partner with cybersecurity firms or academic institutions to gain access to proprietary datasets, network logs, and threat intelligence. These datasets may include real-time attack data, logs from security appliances (firewalls, IDS), or attack simulation data.

Method: 

Secure data-sharing agreements, ensuring proper anonymization and data privacy protocols, and integrate the data into the model for testing and training.
